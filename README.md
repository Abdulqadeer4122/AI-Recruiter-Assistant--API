This FastAPI-based solution is designed to streamline HR processes by providing insights into applicants based on their resumes and job descriptions. It also includes a personality assessment quiz to help HR teams better understand candidates’ qualities. The system leverages advanced language processing techniques, Langchain, Langgraph, FastAPI, and other powerful libraries.
